    <h2>About the Community District Profiles</h2>

    <p>New York City’s 59 community boards were created by local law in 1975, and each represents a community district. These districts range in population from 50,000 to over 200,000, and reflect all the diversity of the City as a whole. The Department of City Planning’s Community District Profiles organize a wide variety of data, maps, and other content to present an accessible view of information about the built environment, key socio-economic conditions, community board perspectives, and planning activities in each district. This information empowers residents, community board members, planners, and other city stakeholders to engage in city planning and advocate for their communities.</p>

    <h3>Indicators</h3>

    <p>The variables in the Indicators section of each profile were carefully selected to present a snapshot across a broad range of conditions related to city planning. An {{fa-icon "info-circle"}} icon displays each indicator’s source. Indicators collected from the American Community Survey (ACS) are calculated at the Public Use Microdata Area (PUMA) level. PUMAs are geographic approximations of community districts, but their boundaries differ slightly. <a href="http://www1.nyc.gov/assets/planning/download/pdf/data-maps/nyc-population/census2010/puma_cd_map.pdf>Use this map</a> to compare PUMA and community district boundaries. Some community districts share a PUMA with another district, and will therefore display identical values for ACS indicators. These paired districts include: Manhattan 1 and 2; Manhattan 4 and 5; Bronx 1 and 2; and Bronx 3 and 6. The 2011-2015 ACS population estimate will not display for districts that share a PUMA because the estimate cannot be reliably disaggregated to each individual district.</p>

    <h3>The Built Environment</h3>

    <p>This section offers a survey of the land uses that currently exist in each district, the zoning that will guide its development, and the public facilities that serve its residents. These are district-specific presentations of data from other City Planning resources on the web. To find out more about land use and zoning in New York City, visit <a href="http://maps.nyc.gov/doitt/nycitymap/template?applicationName=ZOLA">ZoLa</a> or <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/site/planning/data-maps/open-data.page">download the full Primary Land Use Tax Lot Output (PLUTO) and MapPLUTO datasets</a>. For more detailed information on New York City’s public facilities, check out <a href="https://capitalplanning.nyc.gov/facilities">the NYC Facilities Explorer</a>.</p>

    <p>Download each profile’s land use and zoning data as a shapefile with the “PLUTO Data” button in the Downloads window at the bottom of the page. The “Facilities Data” button will download a shapefile of the district’s public facilities.</p>

    <p>Beyond these profiles, the Department of City Planning makes a wealth of data, maps, and reports available <a href="http://www1.nyc.gov/site/planning/data-maps/nyc-population.page">on our website</a>.</p>

    <h3>Community Board Perspectives</h3>

    <p>Each community board is charged with advocating for the unique priorities of its district in collaboration with city agencies. Among their many responsibilities, community boards prepare an annual Statement of Community District Needs and Community Board Budget Requests, which aims to assess the district’s most pressing needs and prioritize capital project and service expenses in the City’s budget. City Planning facilitates the preparation of these documents, and each district’s profile on this website includes statements for fiscal year 2018 and up to ten years prior. A full archive will be available online soon. To request a statement that is not currently available through these profiles, contact <a href="mailto:portal_dl@planning.nyc.gov">portal_dl@planning.nyc.gov</a>.</p>

    <h3>Projects</h3>

    <p>This section presents a summary of the Department of City Planning’s activities in each district. In Recent Land Use Applications, you will find a live look at active and completed land use and environmental review applications in each district from our Land Use & CEQR Application Tracking System (LUCATS). To perform detailed queries of these applications and find help interpreting LUCATS records, <a href="http://a030-lucats.nyc.gov/lucats/welcome.aspx">visit our Applicant Portal</a>.</p>

    <p>The Neighborhood Studies window links to background information on all of the ongoing and recently completed plans and studies that City Planning is conducting in each district. Some districts have no relevant current or recent studies, but <a href="http://www1.nyc.gov/site/planning/plans/proposals-studies.page">visit our website</a> to learn about plans and studies happening across the City, including archives going back decades.</p>

    <h3>Resources</h3>

    <p>For even more Decennial Census and American Community Survey data, the Resources section provides a full summary from the 2010 Census for each district, along with demographic, social, economic, and housing profiles from the 2011-2015 ACS 5-year estimates at the PUMA level. Explore much more Census and ACS data using City Planning’s <a href="http://maps.nyc.gov/census/">NYC Census FactFinder</a> and the <a href="http://www1.nyc.gov/site/planning/data-maps/nyc-population.page">maps and tables on our website</a>.</p>

    <p>Use the buttons in the Download window to access data from the Indicators and Built Environment sections of each profile. For more land use, zoning, and other GIS data, visit <a href="http://www1.nyc.gov/site/planning/data-maps/open-data.page">City Planning’s Open Data page</a>.</p>

    <h3>Technology</h3>

    <p>The Community Profiles Site was built using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software">free and open source software</a> by <a href="https://planninglabs.nyc">NYC Planning Labs</a> working closely with DCP's Planning Coordination Division.  The site is a single-page application (SPA) built using the <a href="https://www.emberjs.com/">ember</a> javascript framework. The frontend application consumes a variety of APIs that serve map tiles, data, and content.</p>

    <p>We make use of the <a href="http://foundation.zurb.com/">foundation</a> framework for layout and basic styling.  Web maps on the profiles are built using <a href="https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/api/">MapboxGL</a>, creating smooth-scaling vector-based maps with intricate control of styling.  Interactive charts are built using <a href="https://d3js.org/">D3.js</a></p>

    <p>The <a href="https://github.com/nycplanning/labs-community-portal/">project repository</a> is on github, where we encourage users to report bugs and feature requests by <a href="https://github.com/nycplanning/labs-community-portal/issues">creating new issues</a>.</p>
